# QSYS_SIMDIR is used in the Quartus-generated IP simulation script to
# construct paths to the files required to simulate the IP in your Quartus
# project. By default, the IP script assumes that you are launching the
# simulator from the IP script location. If launching from another
# location, set QSYS_SIMDIR to the output directory you specified when you
# generated the IP script, relative to the directory from which you launch
# the simulator.
#
# Define the base directory for IP cores if needed, adjust path as necessary
# set IP_BASE_DIR "."
